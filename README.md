# Whitespine

Rust re-implementation of UCI chess engine [Beast](https://github.com/maelic13/beast), the projects have now diverged
and Whitespine is considerably stronger and faster.

Whitespine is only an engine, for proper function you need to pair it with chess GUI. FOr this purpose,
standard UCI protocol is implemented. This should make Whitespine compatible with all well known GUIs.

## Tested GUIs

- Arena
- Chessbase/Fritz
- ChessOK Aquarium

Other GUIs supporting UCI should be compatible as well, but not tested.
